Description: Advanced Linux Security Scanner with AI Intelligence Layer
 Sys-Scan-Graph is a comprehensive Linux security and hygiene scanner that combines
 a high-performance C++20 core scanner with an advanced Python-based Intelligence
 Layer powered by AI and graph analysis.
 .
 The core scanner performs fast host inspection across multiple security domains:
 processes, network sockets, kernel parameters, kernel modules, world-writable
 paths, SUID/SGID binaries, IOC heuristics, and MAC (SELinux/AppArmor) status.
 .
 The Intelligence Layer provides:
 * AI-powered threat analysis and risk assessment
 * Graph-based attack path modeling
 * Automated rule generation and refinement
 * Advanced anomaly detection
 * Integration with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
 * Comprehensive reporting and visualization
 .
 Features deterministic JSON output, noise reduction techniques, and CI-friendly
 operation. Supports both standalone scanning and integrated security workflows.
