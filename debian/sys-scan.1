.TH SYS-SCAN-GRAPH 1 "August 2025" "sys-scan-graph 5.0.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
.B sys-scan-graph
\- advanced Linux security & hygiene scanner with AI Intelligence Layer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sys-scan-graph
[options] [command]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sys-scan-graph
is a comprehensive Linux security and hygiene scanner that combines a high-performance
C++20 core scanner with an advanced Python-based Intelligence Layer powered by AI
and graph analysis.
.PP
The core scanner performs fast host inspection across multiple security domains:
processes, network sockets, kernel parameters, kernel modules, world-writable paths,
SUID/SGID binaries, IOC heuristics, and MAC (SELinux/AppArmor) status.
.PP
The Intelligence Layer provides AI-powered analysis including:
.IP \(bu 2
Threat analysis and risk assessment using LLMs
.IP \(bu 2
Graph-based attack path modeling
.IP \(bu 2
Automated rule generation and refinement
.IP \(bu 2
Advanced anomaly detection
.IP \(bu 2
Comprehensive reporting and visualization
.IP \(bu 2
Zero-trust local AI inference with fine-tuned Mistral-7B model
.PP
Features deterministic JSON output, noise reduction techniques, and CI-friendly
operation. Supports both standalone scanning and integrated security workflows.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR --enable " name[,name...]"
Only run the specified scanners (whitelist). Names match internal scanner identifiers
(e.g. processes, network, modules, suid, ioc, mac, world_writable, kernel_params).
.TP
.BR --disable " name[,name...]"
Disable the specified scanners (blacklist variant).
.TP
.BR --output " FILE"
Write JSON output to FILE instead of stdout.
.TP
.BR --min-severity " SEV"
Filter out findings below SEV (info|low|medium|high|critical).
.TP
.BR --fail-on " SEV"
Exit non-zero if any finding has severity >= SEV after filtering.
.TP
.BR --fail-on-count " N"
Exit non-zero if total finding count (post-filter) >= N.
.TP
.BR --pretty
Pretty-print JSON (basic formatter). Mutually exclusive preference with --compact
(if both supplied, last wins; default is minified deterministic JSON).
.TP
.BR --compact
Force minimal JSON (overrides pretty).
.TP
.BR --all-processes
Include kernel / thread processes lacking cmdline (otherwise skipped as noise).
.TP
.BR --process-hash
Include SHA256 hash (first 1MB) of each process executable when OpenSSL is available.
.TP
.BR --process-inventory
Emit normal process inventory (without requiring anomalies) for broader visibility.
.TP
.BR --max-processes " N"
Cap number of process findings after filtering (performance / size guard).
.TP
.BR --max-sockets " N"
Cap number of network socket findings (performance / size guard).
.TP
.BR --network-debug
Include raw unparsed /proc/net lines to aid parser troubleshooting.
.TP
.BR --network-listen-only
Limit network findings to listening TCP plus all bound UDP sockets.
.TP
.BR --network-proto " tcp|udp"
Restrict network scanner to a single protocol.
.TP
.BR --network-states " list"
Comma-separated TCP states (e.g. LISTEN,ESTABLISHED) for filtering.
.TP
.BR --modules-summary
Collapse full kernel module enumeration into a single summary finding.
.TP
.BR --modules-anomalies-only
Emit only unsigned / out-of-tree module anomalies (suppresses summary/detail).
.TP
.BR --world-writable-dirs " dirs"
Additional comma-separated directory roots to scan for world-writable files.
.TP
.BR --world-writable-exclude " pats"
Comma-separated substrings; matching paths are ignored in world-writable scan.
.TP
.BR --ioc-allow " list"
Comma-separated substrings considered benign for environment IOC heuristics
(downgrades severity rather than suppressing entirely).
.TP
.BR --ioc-allow-file " FILE"
Newline-delimited allowlist file (supports # comments) extending --ioc-allow.
.TP
.BR --suid-expected " list"
Comma-separated additional expected SUID/SGID paths (exact or suffix). Expected
binaries have their severity downgraded to reduce noise.
.TP
.BR --suid-expected-file " FILE"
Newline-delimited expected SUID/SGID paths (supports # comments).
.TP
.BR --help
Show concise usage help and exit.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0 Normal successful execution (and fail-on thresholds not triggered).
.TP
1 A fail condition was met (severity threshold or count) OR internal fatal error.
.TP
2 Command line argument error (missing/unknown flag or missing value).
.SH JSON STRUCTURE (ABRIDGED)
The top-level object contains metadata (tool_version, json_schema_version), a summary
(counts, durations), and an array of per-scanner results with findings. Each finding has:
 id, title, severity, description, metadata (stable key ordering).
.SH SECURITY NOTES
Module scanner invokes system xz/gzip for compressed .ko modules (root-owned source
paths mitigate injection risk). No outbound network connections are made.
