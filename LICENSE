Hybrid License Notice
=====================

This repository contains two logically separated components with different licenses:

Section A. Open Source Core Scanner ("Core")
--------------------------------------------
Directories: `src/`, `rules/`, `schema/`, `fuzz/`, `scripts/`, topâ€‘level CMake / build files, and C++ headers/sources (except files explicitly marked otherwise).

License: MIT License

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of the Core and associated documentation files (the "Core Software"), to deal
in the Core Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Core Software, and to permit persons to whom the Core Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Core Software.

THE CORE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE CORE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
THE CORE SOFTWARE.

Section B. Proprietary Intelligence Layer ("Intelligence Layer")
----------------------------------------------------------------
Directory: `agent/` and any subdirectories (Python enrichment / correlation / HTML reporting) and generated enriched artifacts unless otherwise noted.

License: Restricted Proprietary License

Copyright (c) 2025 J-mazz. All rights reserved.

You are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use the
Intelligence Layer internally for evaluation or operation on systems you own or
administer in conjunction with the open source Core. Any modification,
redistribution (source or binary), sublicensing, external hosting (SaaS), or
commercial use of the Intelligence Layer requires a separate commercial
agreement or written permission from the copyright holder.

You may not:
1. Publicly redistribute the Intelligence Layer source code or derived works.
2. Offer the Intelligence Layer as a hosted or managed service to third parties.
3. Remove or alter proprietary notices.

Limited Derivative Works Clause:
You may create internal derivatives (patches, custom integrations) of the
Intelligence Layer for your own organizational use provided they are not
distributed externally.

NO WARRANTY: The Intelligence Layer is provided "AS IS" without warranties of
any kind (same warranty disclaimer as MIT above applies).

Combination & Aggregation:
Linking or executing the open source Core together with the proprietary
Intelligence Layer in combined workflows does not convert the license of either
component; each part retains its respective license.

Third-Party Components:
Third-party libraries remain under their original licenses. Nothing herein
grants rights to third-party marks or code outside their stated terms.

Contributions:
Pull requests affecting Core code are accepted under the MIT license (you agree
your contribution is MIT licensed). Contributions to the Intelligence Layer are
not accepted unless explicitly requested; unsolicited submissions become the
property of the project maintainers without obligation.
