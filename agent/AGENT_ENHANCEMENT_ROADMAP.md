# Agent Enhancement Roadmap

## Current State Analysis
The agent currently has:
- ✅ Batch processing optimizations for finding loops
- ✅ Knowledge base with ports, modules, SUID programs, and organizations
- ✅ LLM provider abstraction with fallback chains
- ✅ Rule-based correlation and gap mining
- ✅ Risk assessment and compliance checking

## Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. **Enhanced Knowledge Base**
- **Semantic Search**: Add vector embeddings for knowledge retrieval
- **Contextual Enrichment**: Cross-reference findings with threat intelligence
- **Dynamic Learning**: Update knowledge base from scan results
- **Multi-language Support**: Extend beyond English contexts

### 2. **Intuitive Interaction Patterns**
- **Conversational Memory**: Track user preferences and context
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show basic info first, details on demand
- **Visual Summaries**: Generate charts/graphs for complex data
- **Natural Language Queries**: Accept plain English questions about findings

### 3. **Advanced Reasoning**
- **Causal Analysis**: Explain why findings are connected
- **Impact Assessment**: Quantify business risk of security issues
- **Remediation Planning**: Suggest prioritized fix sequences
- **Predictive Analysis**: Forecast potential future issues

### 4. **Knowledge Expansion**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**: Map findings to tactics/techniques
- **Industry Benchmarks**: Compare against similar organizations
- **Regulatory Mapping**: Link to specific compliance requirements
- **Threat Intelligence**: Real-time threat feed integration

### 5. **User Experience**
- **Interactive Mode**: Allow users to drill down into findings
- **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable views and alerts
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate executive summaries
- **Integration APIs**: REST/webhook interfaces for other tools

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Knowledge Enhancement
1. Add semantic search to knowledge base
2. Implement contextual enrichment
3. Create threat intelligence feeds
4. Add MITRE ATT&CK mapping

### Phase 2: Interaction Improvements
1. Add conversational memory
2. Implement natural language queries
3. Create visual summaries
4. Add interactive exploration

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Implement causal analysis
2. Add predictive capabilities
3. Create remediation planning
4. Build integration APIs

## Quick Wins
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Improve LLM prompts for better explanations
