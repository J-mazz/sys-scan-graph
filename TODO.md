# **sys-scan-graph: Unified Intelligence Core Roadmap**

## **Vision: LangGraph-Powered Intelligence Platform**

The future of sys-scan-graph is not a C++ scanner with a Python script attached; it is a single, cohesive product where the **LangGraph-powered agent is the central intelligence core.** This represents a fundamental architectural shift: we are moving from a linear data-processing pipeline to a dynamic, stateful, and conversational analysis engine.

**Key Principles:**

- **LangGraph as Default:** The LangGraph workflow becomes the sole, non-optional execution path
- **Security-First:** Multi-layered security architecture with guardrails, validation, and sanitization
- **Unified API:** Both CLI and GUI become thin clients to the central agent
- **Architectural Consolidation:** Legacy pipeline deprecated, LangGraph becomes canonical implementation

---

## **Phase 0: Architectural Consolidation (Foundation Sprint)**

**Goal:** Establish LangGraph as the central intelligence core and consolidate the architecture around this new paradigm.

### **\[P0\] Make LangGraph the Default Execution Path**

**Status:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PRIORITY - Architectural foundation

- **Issue:** Mixed execution paths create confusion and maintenance burden
- **Actions:**
  - **File:** agent/cli.py - Remove `--graph` flag, make LangGraph the sole execution path
  - **File:** agent/graph.py - Modify build_workflow to default to "enhanced" mode
  - **File:** Move agent/pipeline.py to agent/legacy/pipeline.py
  - **Docs:** Update README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect LangGraph as canonical implementation
- **Impact:** Eliminates architectural ambiguity, establishes single source of truth

### **\[P0\] Implement Multi-Layered Security Architecture**

**Status:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PRIORITY - Security foundation

- **Issue:** Powerful conversational agent requires comprehensive security hardening
- **Actions:**
  - **Create GuardrailNode:** New LangGraph node for prompt sanitization and intent classification
  - **Tool Access Control:** Implement Pydantic validation for all agent/tools.py functions
  - **Output Sanitization:** Add strict parse-then-validate for all LLM-generated structured data
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Narrowly scope all tool functions
- **Impact:** Zero-trust security model protecting against prompt injection and privilege escalation

### **\[P0\] Develop Unified API Layer**

**Status:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PRIORITY - Interface foundation

- **Issue:** Need single gateway for both CLI and GUI to access intelligence core
- **Actions:**
  - **Create API Module:** New agent/api.py for managing LangGraph agent lifecycles
  - **WebSocket Support:** Implement persistent connections for GUI, single-shot for CLI
  - **State Management:** Handle stateful agent instances across multiple client connections
  - **Protocol Definition:** Establish clear message format for agent communication
- **Impact:** Enables both CLI and GUI as thin clients to the same intelligence core

---

## **Phase 1: Security Hardening & Core Stabilization**

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive security measures and eliminate critical bugs that could compromise the intelligence core.

### **Fix the EbpfScanner ODR Violation**

**Status:** ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY - Build-breaking bug

- **Issue:** One Definition Rule (ODR) violation prevents core eBPF feature from being used
- **Action Required:**
  - EbpfScanner.cpp must `#include "EbpfScanner.h"`
  - Remove duplicate inline class redefinition in .cpp file
  - Provide definitions for all methods declared in header
- **Verification:** Project builds cleanly with WITH_EBPF=ON on GCC and Clang, eBPF scanner produces findings in integration test

### **Fix Hardcoded bpftool Path in CMake**

**Status:** ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY - Build portability issue

- **Issue:** Hardcoded bpftool path prevents portable builds across different systems
- **Actions:**
  - **File:** CMakeLists.txt
  - **Remove:** `set(BPFTOOL "/usr/lib/linux-tools-6.8.0-79/bpftool")`
  - **Replace with:**

    ```cmake
    find_program(BPFTOOL_EXECUTABLE bpftool)
    if(NOT BPFTOOL_EXECUTABLE)
        if(WITH_EBPF_STRICT)
            message(FATAL_ERROR "bpftool not found in PATH, required for WITH_EBPF_STRICT")
        else()
            message(WARNING "bpftool not found in PATH, eBPF scanners will be disabled")
            set(WITH_EBPF OFF)
        endif()
    endif()
    ```

  - **Update usage:** Replace all `${BPFTOOL}` references with `${BPFTOOL_EXECUTABLE}`

### **Modernize Library Finding in CMake**

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Build system modernization

- **Issue:** Manual find_library calls are less portable than package-based approach
- **Actions:**
  - **File:** CMakeLists.txt
  - **Replace libseccomp block:**

    ```cmake
    find_package(Libseccomp QUIET)
    if(Libseccomp_FOUND)
        target_link_libraries(sys_scan_core PUBLIC Libseccomp::seccomp)
        target_compile_definitions(sys_scan_core PUBLIC SYS_SCAN_HAVE_SECCOMP=1)
    endif()
    ```

  - **Apply similar pattern to libcap**
  - **Benefits:** Better portability across Linux distributions

### **Unify the Risk Model**

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Architectural consistency

- **Issue:** Conceptual clash between C++ base_severity_score and Python agent's holistic risk_score
- **Decision:** C++ provides ONLY base_severity_score derived from finding severity; Python agent calculates final risk_score
- **Actions:**
  - **C++:** Rename `risk_score` field to `base_severity_score` in Finding struct
  - **Python (models.py):** Update Pydantic Finding model to have `base_severity_score: int` as required field
  - **Python (models.py):** Initialize `risk_score: int` from `base_severity_score` using Pydantic model_validator
  - **Python (pipeline.py):** Remove manual logic copying base_severity_score to risk_score
  - **Docs:** Update model documentation strings to explain the flow

### **Separate Operational Errors from Security Findings**

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Alert quality issue

- **Issue:** Scanner health issues conflated with security signals, creating alert fatigue
- **Actions:**
  - **C++:** In Report.cpp, hardcode base_severity_score to 0 for findings with operational_error=true
  - **Python:** Filter out operational_error=true findings from risk calculation in pipeline.py and risk.py
  - **Docs:** Update ARCHITECTURE.md and README.md to clarify operational errors are excluded from risk scoring

  - **Role-Based Access:** Future support for different user permission levels
  - **Audit Logging:** Track all tool usage for security monitoring
- **Impact:** Prevents malicious tool execution and privilege escalation

### **Implement LLM Output Sanitization**

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Security enhancement

- **Issue:** LLM outputs must be treated as untrusted until validated
- **Actions:**
  - **Parse-Then-Validate:** Strict JSON parsing followed by Pydantic model validation
  - **Content Sanitization:** Strip harmful HTML/script tags from natural language outputs
  - **Structured Data Validation:** All structured outputs validated against schemas
  - **Fallback Handling:** Graceful degradation when validation fails
- **Impact:** Prevents injection attacks and malformed data propagation

- **Actions:**
  - **File:** agent/report_html.py
  - **Add client-side JavaScript:**
    - `filterFindings()` function for text search
    - `filterBySeverity(sev)` function for severity filtering
  - **Add HTML elements:**
    - Search input: `<input type="text" onkeyup="filterFindings(this.value)" placeholder="Search findings...">`
    - Severity buttons: `<button onclick="filterBySeverity('high')">High</button>`
  - **Benefits:** Improved usability for large security reports

### **Harden the C++ Rule Engine**

**Status:** ï¿½ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Robustness issue

- **Issue:** Unhandled exceptions in rule parsing could crash entire scanner
- **Actions:**
  - **C++:** Enhance try/catch in RuleEngine.cpp for std::regex compilation
  - **C++:** Log rule ID, filename, and specific regex pattern on failure
