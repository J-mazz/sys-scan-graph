# Business Source License 1.1 FAQ

## What is the Business Source License (BSL)?

The Business Source License (BSL) is a source-available license that allows for commercial use while requiring businesses to purchase a commercial license for certain use cases. It's designed to balance open-source benefits with sustainable business models.

## How does BSL 1.1 work for sys-scan-graph?

The Intelligence Layer of sys-scan-graph is licensed under BSL 1.1 with the following key parameters:

- **Licensor**: Joseph Mazzini
- **Licensed Work**: sys-scan-graph Intelligence Layer (agent/)
- **Change Date**: January 1, 2028
- **Change License**: Apache License, Version 2.0

## What can I do with BSL-licensed code?

### Permitted Uses (No Commercial License Required)

You may use the BSL-licensed Intelligence Layer for:

- **Internal evaluation and testing**
- **Academic research and educational purposes**
- **Personal development and experimentation**
- **Contributing via pull requests to the project**
- **Non-production internal operations**

### Uses Requiring Commercial License

You must purchase a commercial license for:

- **Production use**
- **SaaS/hosted offerings**
- **Commercial redistribution**
- **Any commercial exploitation**

## When does the license change?

On **January 1, 2028**, the BSL 1.1 license will automatically convert to **Apache License, Version 2.0**, making the code fully open source.

## How do I get a commercial license?

For commercial licensing inquiries, contact:
- **Email**: Joseph@Mazzlabs.works
- **Subject**: Commercial License Inquiry - sys-scan-graph

## What about the Core Scanner?

The Core Scanner (C++ components) is based on the original MIT-licensed `J-mazz/sys-scan` repository but includes proprietary enhancements. The licensing for the core scanner is separate from the Intelligence Layer.

## Can I contribute to the project?

Yes! Contributions are welcome and encouraged. The project maintains an open contribution process:

- **Pull requests** are accepted for bug fixes and improvements
- **Issue reports** help improve the project
- **Documentation contributions** are always appreciated
- **Community discussions** help shape the roadmap

## What happens if I violate the license?

The BSL includes automatic termination provisions. If your use violates the license terms:

- Your rights under the BSL automatically terminate
- You must cease all use of the licensed work
- You may need to purchase a commercial license retroactively
- Continued use without proper licensing may have legal consequences

## Why BSL instead of traditional open source?

BSL provides several benefits:

- **Sustainable development**: Ensures the project can be maintained and improved
- **Fair compensation**: Commercial users contribute to ongoing development
- **Community access**: Non-commercial users have full access
- **Automatic conversion**: Becomes fully open source after a defined period
- **Business-friendly**: Clear terms for commercial adoption

## Is BSL approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI)?

No, BSL is not OSI-approved as it's not a traditional open-source license. However, it is widely recognized as a legitimate source-available license and is used by many successful projects.

## Can I use BSL-licensed code in my proprietary product?

It depends on your use case:

- **Internal use only**: Yes, permitted without commercial license
- **Bundled in proprietary product for internal use**: Yes, permitted
- **SaaS/hosted offering**: Requires commercial license
- **Commercial redistribution**: Requires commercial license

## What if I'm not sure about my use case?

When in doubt:
1. Review the license terms in `agent/LICENSE`
2. Contact Joseph@Mazzlabs.works for clarification
3. Consider the spirit of the license: fair compensation for commercial exploitation
